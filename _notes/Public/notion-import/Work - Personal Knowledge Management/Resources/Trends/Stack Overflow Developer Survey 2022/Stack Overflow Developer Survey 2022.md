## Overview

The questions we ask in our annual survey help us improve the Stack Overflow community and the platform that serves them.

The challenge and opportunity for us is to continue expanding and improving our ability to help all developers and to make them feel welcome in our community.

Read on for more great insights about the attitudes, tools, and environments that are shaping the art and practice of software today.

[](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#developer-profile)[**Developer Profile**](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#developer-profile)[Learning to code](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/\#developer-profile)

Learning to code online increased from 60% to 70% year over year.

Respondents older than 45 years are most likely to have learned from books, while younger ones are learning online. Younger (under 18) respondents rely most on online resources and are most likely to have learned from online courses or certifications.

## Developer roles

Few developers consider themselves to be a single developer type, showing us their skill diversity.

### [Developer type](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#developer-type)

Full-stack, back-end, front-end, and desktop developers continue to account for the majority of all respondents. We asked about Cloud infrastructure engineer for the first time this year - almost 9% classify themselves as this type of developer.

Developers are wearing multiple hats. The majority of respondents said they considered themselves to be more than one type of developer - with DBAs, SREs, and Security professionals reporting the most variety. On average each of these roles reported being seven other developer types.

### [Gender](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#gender)

Those learning to code are slightly less likely to identify as a man and slightly more likely to prefer to not identify. Both of these are indications that the industry (and our survey) could continue to become more diverse as more people join the workforce.

92% of all respondents and 93% of Professional Developers identify as a man. The United States has the highest percentage of gender minorities (Woman, Non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming). We have considerable work to do to ensure our platform is inclusive and that our survey is representative of developers everywhere.

## Technology

Each year we explore the tools and technologies developers are currently using and what they want to use.

We have the favorite Loved, Dreaded, and Wanted data as well as Worked With vs. Want to Work With, which shows us precisely what developers used in the past year and what they want to work on in the following year. If you need a refresher on how we structure Loved, Dread and Wanted, or if you want to read about the intuition behind Worked With vs. Want to Work With, check out this post [our meta post](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/410519/what-is-worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-in-the-developer-survey-results).

Technology

## Most popular technologies

This year, we're comparing the popular technologies across three different groups: All respondents, Professional Developers, and those that are learning to code.

### [Programming, scripting, and markup languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)

2022 marks JavaScript’s tenth year in a row as the most commonly used programming language.

But, it’s a different picture for those learning to code. HTML/CSS, Javascript and Python are almost tied as the most popular languages for people learning to code. People learning to code are more likely than Professional Developers to report using Python (58% vs 44%), C++ (35% vs 20%), and C (32% vs 17%).

Compared to Professional Developers, those learning to code are less likely to report using SQL (38% vs 53%), TypeScript (15% vs 40%), and Bash/Shell (19% vs 29%).

### [Databases](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#databases)

For Professional Developers PostgreSQL just barely took over the first place spot from MySQL. Professional Developers are more likely than those learning to code to use Redis, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Elasticsearch.

MongoDB is used by a similar percentage of both Professional Developers and those learning to code and it’s the second most popular database for those learning to code (behind MySQL). This makes sense since it supports a large number of languages and application development platforms.

### [Cloud platforms](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#cloud-platforms)

AWS remains the most used cloud platform for all respondents and for Professional Developers. Azure took the second-place spot from Google Cloud.

People learning to code have much different usage of cloud platforms. Heroku is the most used platform for those learning to code (35%), significantly higher than Professional Developers (18%). We see similar differences with Google Cloud (31% learning to code; 26% Professional Developers), Firebase (30% learning to code; 21% Professional Developers), VMware (12% learning to code; 8% Professional Developers).

You can see the inroads that AWS and Azure have with organizations - significantly more Professional Developers are using those platforms compared to people who are learning to code.

### [Other frameworks and libraries](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#other-frameworks-and-libraries)

This year we added additional responses to see the most popular libraries in different domains. For example, TensorFlow remains more popular than PyTorch for machine learning but Scikit-learn is close behind TensorFlow. Flutter and React Native are the two most popular cross-platform tools.

People learning to code are more likely than Professional Developer to be using NumPy (43% vs 24%), Pandas (35% vs 22%) - this makes sense given that they are both Python based and people learning to code are using Python. They are also more likely to be using TensorFlow (18% vs 11%) and Scikit-learn (17% vs 11%).

### [Asynchronous tools](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#asynchronous-tools)

We see definite differences between Professional Developers and people learning to code when it comes to asynchronous work tools. Jira is most used by Professional Developers (49%) but only used by 15% of those learning to code. It’s a similar story with Confluence, the second most used tool by Professional Developers (43%) but only used by 8% of those learning to code. For people starting their career, few of them will have experience with these tools, potentially increasing their time to ramp up on how to use them.

On the flip side, people who are learning to code are using Notion (36% vs 19%) and Trello (43% vs 32%) as their asynchronous work tools.

Technology

## Most loved, dreaded, and wanted

Always one of the most popular series, we have some technologies/tools that are maintaining their position as most loved (Rust), and some that have unseated leaders (PostgreSQL).

[Programming, scripting, and markup languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)

Rust is on its seventh year as the most loved language with 87% of developers saying they want to continue using it.

Rust also ties with Python as the most wanted technology with TypeScript running a close second.

Technology

## Worked with vs. want to work with

Developers are naturally curious and interested in new technologies. We look at what technologies they are interested in trying based on what they are using now.

[Programming, scripting, and markup languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)

Similar to last year we see over 10k Javascript developers that want to start or continue developing in Go or Rust.

[All Respondents](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-language-worked-want) [Professional Developers](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-language-worked-want-prof) [Learning to Code](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#worked-with-vs-want-to-work-with-language-worked-want-learn)

Minimum 5,000 respondents per connection.

Which **programming, scripting, and markup languages** have you done extensive development work in over the past year, and which do you want to work in over the next year? (If you both worked with the language and want to continue to do so, please check both boxes in that row.)

[Databases](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#databases)

## Top paying technologies

### [Top paying technologies](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#top-paying-technologies)

Clojure remains the highest-paid language to know. Chef developers are the highest paid but Chef is also the most dreaded other tool.

Big-data and data streaming skills are well compensated with Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Hadoop all in the top three other frameworks and libraries.

Additionally, developers that have colocation experience are paid more than their cloud-only counterparts.

Methodology

## General

This report is based on a survey of 73,268 software developers from 180 countries around the world. This is the number of responses we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on time spent on the full, completed survey; another approximately 53 responses were submitted but not included in the analysis because respondents spent less than three minutes on the survey.

The survey was fielded from May 11, 2022 to June 1, 2022.

The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 15.08 minutes. An increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.

Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.

As an incentive, respondents who finished the survey could opt in to a “Census” badge if they completed the survey.

Due to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.

Many questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.

We asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency and whether that salary was weekly, monthly, or yearly.

The salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 38,071 respondents who gave us salary data.

We converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on May 24, 2022 and also converted to annual salaries assuming 12 working months and 50 working weeks.

The top approximately 2% of salaries inside and outside of the US were trimmed and replaced with threshold values. The threshold values for inside and outside the US were different.

To identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, we looked at both the most popular and fastest-growing tags on Stack Overflow (in terms of questions posted). We compared these to the technologies we included last year and looked at how many people chose each option. We synthesized all this together to curate a collection of technologies to include.

The questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order. Also, the answers to most questions were randomized in order.

Free form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.
