Proposal: Investing in .NET Web Development Training

Hey [Boss's First Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I recently stumbled upon the .NET Web Academy, a comprehensive online learning platform that dives deep into .NET web development. Having gone through what's on offer, I genuinely believe it's a goldmine for someone in my position.

Here's why I think it's worth considering:

**Extensive Curriculum** The program includes an array of topics, from .NET Web API essentials to advanced Blazor techniques and Identity Framework, within .NET 8. It's a thorough resource for mastering .NET web development.

**Practical Experience:** It's hands-on! We'd be building complete single-page applications (SPAs) from scratch. This practical approach could significantly enhance our internal projects and streamline our development workflows.

**Community and Support:** Beyond the courses, there's an active community for ongoing discussions, queries, and collaborations, ensuring continued learning and networking opportunities.

**Professional Certificate:** Completing the courses earns a digital certificate, enhancing personal growth and adding to our team's qualifications.

**Return on Investment:** The skills acquired could lead to more efficient project contributions, potentially reducing reliance on external help and cutting down troubleshooting time.

For more information about the courses and what they offer, you can visit the .NET Web Academy here: <https://www.dotnetwebacademy.com>

However, there's a limited enrollment window of just two weeks, so prompt action is necessary.

I'm eager to enroll and was hoping [Company Name] might support this as part of our professional development initiative. I believe the benefits far outweigh the investment.

Looking forward to your thoughts on this. Let me know if you need more information!

Thank you for considering this.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

## Frequently Asked Questions

When does the .NET Web Academy start?

As soon as you are enrolled in the program you can start watching all courses at your own pace.

How long is this program?

The .NET Web Academy consists of over 26 hours of video content (growing every month), supplemented with quizzes and exercises, all organized into distinct sections.

While you have the flexibility to complete the courses at your own speed, I suggest breaking it down into manageable portions to fully absorb the content. Spacing it out can enhance understanding.

Will the lectures still be available after the program expires?

There actually is no expiration date. As a member you get access to the complete .NET Web Academy content and the .NET Web Academy Community.

How is this different from your Udemy courses (e.g. .NET Jumpstart or Blazor E-Commerce)?

My intention with the .NET Web Academy is to go deeper and also cover job-related issues, such as handling Git with feature branches and merging code, as well as publishing your full-stack application with Azure.

Additionally, since we are a much smaller cohort compared to Udemy, I want to focus on the community. In other words: I want to be there for you. So if you have questions or are struggling with code, I'm going to respond quickly and record new videos just for you.

Can I receive an invoice after subscribing to the .NET Web Academy?

Of course! After completing your purchase of the .NET Web Academy, an invoice will be sent to your registered email address automatically. Make sure to enter your details (e.g. address, VAT, etc.) correctly upon subscribing.

Your satisfaction is my priority, so don't hesitate to let me know how I can assist further.

What is the "Cancel Anytime" policy?

You may cancel your subscription to the .NET Web Academy at any point before your next billing period, no questions asked. "Cancel anytime" means you can turn off the auto-renewal for your subscription whenever you'd like.

## Don't just take my word for it

I have had a great time as one of the first members of the academy. The lessons were very well presented and the slide material was very easy to read and follow. I have learned heaps from this course and highly recommend it.

Zak Karachiwala

Domain Architect at John Holland

I had spent a lot of time working with Blazor in 2020 but had to drop it. When it came time to get reacquainted with Blazor I was looking for a course that used the latest technology and covered the entire process of building a Blazor Wasm application from the ground up. I'm happy to report that Patrick's Blazor course was the perfect choice. The pacing is brisk and packed with useful information. The TailwindCss module was one of my favorites; it‚Äôs not just a great introduction to Tailwind, but goes into creating custom controls in a way that is incredibly powerful for building large scale applications. In short, if you want to learn Blazor from someone using the latest technology and answers forum questions in a timely and comprehensive manner, then this is the course for you.

Michael Vandemore

Software Developer at DATAGENICS SOFTWARE INC

Patrick is an incredibly gifted programmer and educator. He writes code effortlessly and does a beautiful job of explaining concepts, the code structure, and how everything interacts with each other. He is patient and supportive and can efficiently work with beginners and people with more advanced skills. Patrick is among the best instructors I‚Äôve ever worked with, and I give him my highest recommendation.

Mike Schoenbach, MBA

Dynamic and results-driven professional

It is always a pleasure to work with Patrick, as he is an outstanding problem solver and software engineer. He is known for his strong analytical skills and always focuses on the problem at hand in a productive manner. I experience him as a professional software engineer with a strong skill set in both, frontend and backend development.

I love this course! Learning so much from this course, Patrick explains everything so well, even with a bit of humour and irony!
