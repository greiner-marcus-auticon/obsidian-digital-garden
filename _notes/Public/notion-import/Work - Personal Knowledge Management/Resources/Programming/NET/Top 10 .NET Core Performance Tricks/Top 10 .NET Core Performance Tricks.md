Hey there! Today, I’m sharing some straightforward ways to speed up your .NET Core apps. No fancy words, just simple stuff that works.

Let’s dive in!

## 1. Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming in .NET Core is a powerful way to enhance the scalability and responsiveness of your applications.

It allows your program to handle other tasks while waiting for operations, like I/O processes, to complete.

## When to Use Asynchronous Programming

- **I/O Bound Operations:** Use async programming for operations that involve data access, file reading/writing, network calls, etc., where the program waits for an external process to complete.
- **UI Responsiveness:** In desktop applications, use async to keep the UI responsive during long-running tasks.
- **Scalability in Web Applications:** Use async in web applications to handle more requests by freeing up threads while waiting for database queries or API calls.

## Best Practices

- Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` when awaiting tasks in a library to avoid deadlocks.
- Always catch exceptions in asynchronous methods to prevent unhandled exceptions.
- When writing asynchronous APIs, expose asynchronous methods alongside synchronous ones, if possible.

**Code example:**

```Plain
public async Task<ActionResult> GetUserData()
{
    var userData = await _userService.GetUserDataAsync();
    return View(userData);
}

public async Task<string> ReadFileContentAsync(string filePath)
{
    using (var reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
    {
        return await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
    }
}
```

## When Not to Use Asynchronous Programming

- **CPU-bound Operations:** If the task involves intensive computation, async programming might not bring benefits and can complicate your code.
- **Simple Synchronous Tasks:** For operations that complete quickly and are not blocking, asynchronous programming…
