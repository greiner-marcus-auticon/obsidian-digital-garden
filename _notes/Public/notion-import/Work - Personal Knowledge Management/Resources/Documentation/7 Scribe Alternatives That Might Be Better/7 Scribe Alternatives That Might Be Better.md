I was digging through Scribe‚Äôs website to find if there is anything I missed, and I came across this description:

‚ÄùHow to _how to_‚Äù

It‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs genius, but **not good enough to explain why it has only one feature.**

**Yup. The tool has only one single feature.**

_Yet it costs more than my prepaid plan._

This one feature is honestly a lifesaver for developers that are sick of doing the step-by-step documentation of what they actually did and how their tool works, _but_, this feature isn‚Äôt really worth this price.

That‚Äôs why I will be talking about:

- [What Scribe is](https://userguiding.com/blog/scribe-alternatives-competitors/#1)
- [Why you might need an alternative to Scribe](https://userguiding.com/blog/scribe-alternatives-competitors/#2)
- [And The Best 6 Alternatives & Competitors of Scribe](https://userguiding.com/blog/scribe-alternatives-competitors/#3)

_So, without further ado, let‚Äôs begin with:_

## TL;DR

- Scribe is a documentation tool for developers that need step-by-step instructions about what their code does.
- It follows your mouse along while you complete actions on your screens as usual, and automatically turns it into a guide.
- **The idea os Scribe is actually very good, except for the part where it is much more expensive than most other competitors.**
- The best alternative to Scribe is **UserGuiding** because it provides multiple times more features, but doesn‚Äôt cost as much.
- UserGuiding provides step-by-step instruction guides along with resource centers, checklists, easy language localization, tooltips, hotsports, announcements modals, etc.
- Other alternatives include UiPath‚Äôs StepShot, Fleeq, Iorad, CloudApp, Loom, and Shepherd.

## What is Scribe?

[Scribe,](https://get.scribehow.com/lp-1/?via=renk) also known as Scribehow is a cloud-based tool from the United States that allows you to create tutorials in minutes.

![[assets/scribe-scribehow-dashboard.png]]

Scribe is a simple tool. It follows your mouse movements through a chrome extension, and creates step-by-step instructions of what you did.

But what makes Scribe stand out from other similar tools?

**The answer is simple. The tool is so easy to use that anyone can do it, saving time and effort from practice.**

The main difference between Scribehow and its competitors is that Scribe doesn‚Äôt require any programming knowledge, and the recording process is completely automated.

You just have to fill a file when creating your first guide. Then you‚Äôre ready to start adding content, images, a video file, an audio file or anything else you want.

![[assets/scribe-scribehow-alternatives.png]]

If you don‚Äôt know how to use a specific feature, there‚Äôs always someone who will help you.

Still, none of these explain why you would want to pay such an amount of money every month for a tool that has only one feature.

### Scribe Software Pricing

- **Basic Plan:** Free, includes individual projects only
- **Pro Plan:** $29/month per user, includes branded guides
- **Enterprise Plan:** Custom quotation with knowledge base integration

### Scribe Review

üëç Pros:

üëé Cons:

### Why you need a Scribe Alternative

_There might be a number of reasons for your search of an alternative to Scribe. Here is what caught my eye first:_

### 1- Pricey for the value üí∏

Scribe helps you create screenshot guides. That‚Äôs all. For a team of 3, the tool would cost $87/month to use this feature only. There are other options such as UserGuiding which do tons more and cost less.

### 2- It has one job, but‚Ä¶ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The tool is not yet fully developed, and the software does not pick up on every link you click or page you open, causing the recording to have plot holes and be inefficient.

Also, maybe a small one, but **I experienced a bug from day 2**. My scribe onboarding checklist froze and stopped working. How am I supposed to trust the tool while they can‚Äôt even properly onboard their own users?

### 3- Zero customizability üé®

If you are using Scribe for personal purposes, you might not need many customization options. But for commercial uses, customizability and invisibility are key. If you want to look professional to your clients/employees, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Scribehow at all.

## Top Scribe Alternatives

_Here are the top 7 alternatives to Scribe:_

1. _UserGuiding_
2. _UiPath_
3. _Fleeq_
4. _Iorad_
5. _CloudApp_
6. _Loom_
7. _Shepherd.js_

We‚Äôll go over each tool, how it compares to [Scribe](https://get.scribehow.com/lp-1/?via=renk), and in which cases they should be preferred. Without further ado, let‚Äôs start with our first product:

### 1- UserGuiding‚Äôs UG Now vs. Scribe

[**UserGuiding**](https://userguiding.com/) **is the leading online onboarding process provider and customer experience tool, both in terms of features and pricing.**

UserGuiding is the most affordable tool on the market that provides flexible solutions, due to the variety of features it provides, such as:

- Cloud-based online website walkthroughs,
- Resource and help centers
- In-app announcements, tooltips, hotspots
- NPS surveys
- Process Documentation and offline guides (UG Now)

_It also gives the feeling of artificial intelligence and professionalism, but I don‚Äôt know if that counts._

![[assets/userguiding-gamification-software.jpg]]

**So,** [**UG Now**](https://help.userguiding.com/en/articles/5358722-userguiding-now)**, a feature of UserGuiding does everything that Scribe does. I don‚Äôt need to mention anything more than that fact that it‚Äôs also more affordable than Scribe.**

Yet, no tool is perfect. If you need detailed analytics, UserGuiding might need a couple of integration to deliver the best.

### UserGuiding Pricing

- 14-day free trial (no credit card required)
- **Basic Plan:** $69/month when billed annually for up to 2500 MAU
- **Professional Plan:** $299/month when billed annually for up to 20000 MAU with unlimited guides
- **Custom Quotation Available for Larger Companies**

### UserGuiding Review

UserGuiding also offers free migration services for your in-app content created using other software **to minimize your switching costs.**

### 2- UiPath vs. Scribe

[UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/?utm_source=GoogleSearch&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=uipath-e&utm_content=543050203133&utm_campaign=StudioDownload&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzfuNBhCGARIsAD1nu-_MTqdwSBx3uzTWgCPlxFYRcpCPTU_FcVNRI6yjbCFoX4CONO5OBuQaAiIwEALw_wcB) is a software application used to automate business processes by building workflows

![[assets/UiPath-vs-Iorad.png]]

UiPath is originally an artificial intelligence-powered real-time automation tool, but the reason UiPath made its way into our list is that it has a tutorial creation add-on.

This tool is in the list because it acquired StepShot, a really similar tool to Scribe, except for the video file upload option, and now can be used for documentation as well.

_Apart from the fact that it does nothing but screenshot taking._

But if you plan to purchase an automation tool, keep in mind that UiPath includes the walkthrough feature that you need.

### UiPath Software Pricing

- **Automation Developer: $420/month** without automation support.
- **Unattended Automation: $1380/month** with limited automation support.
- **Automation Team: $1930/month** with full automation support.
- **Enterprise and Medium Business: custom** **quote** for each company.

### UiPath Review

### 3- Fleeq vs. Scribe

[Fleeq](https://www.fleeq.io/) is a relatively newer tool for creating and sharing animated GIFs from video files.

![[assets/fleeq-website.png]]

Fleeq allows you to take recordings with your camera, choose the moments you want to share, and have them immediately converted into stylish animated gifs that you can simply upload on your website.

The tool stands out with its ease of use and affordable pricing, but still, it‚Äôs not the most comprehensive tool.

### Fleeq Software Pricing

- 14-day **free trial** available
- **Enterprise plan:** contact the sales team to get a price.

### Fleeq Review

### 4- Iorad vs. Scribe

[Iorad](https://userguiding.com/blog/iorad-alternatives-competitors/) is a software that allows you to build step-by-step guides as you move through the process.

![[assets/Iorad-dashboard.png]]

You can record both video and audio, as well as your screen, using Iorad. If necessary, you can also include descriptions and headings for each stage, as well as an introduction and an appendix. Iorad also allows you to highlight or blur parts on the screen to make the instruction more accurate.

**If you just want it for personal usage, Iorad is a good tool; otherwise, the prices are too costly for a product with only one use.**

Simply said, Iorad serves as a demo help center, but it is not free of charge.

### Iorad Pricing

_For personal use:_

- Iorad is free for personal use.

_For business use:_

- **Starter plan: $200/month** with an additional $15 for one additional creator.
- **Pro plan: $500/month** with an additional $20 for each additional creator.
- **Company plan: $3200/month** with an additional $40 for each additional creator.
- **Enterprise plan: custom quote** for personalized needs.

_For educational purposes:_

- **Educators plan: $10/month** for teachers and professors.
- **Institution plan: up to 80% off** for school districts and universities.

_For non-profit organizations:_

- **Non-profit plan: up to 50% off** for non-profit organizations

### Iorad Review

### 5- CloudApp vs. Scribe

[CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) is an easy-to-use, cloud-based video recording tool that allows you to record, edit, and analyze.

CloudApp is a free web application for managing your videos online.

It‚Äôs a simple, yet powerful, cloud-based solution for easily creating, editing, sharing, and analyzing your videos.

_You can use CloudApp to:_

- Create professional-looking videos quickly,
- Edit videos within the app using advanced features like trimming, cropping, adding effects, and more
- Analyze videos by viewing them side by side with other clips, comparing different shots, or finding specific parts of a video.

### CloudApp Pricing

- **Free plan** available up to 50 screen capture
- **Pro Plan:** starting at **$9.95/month** with unlimited screen capture
- **Team Plan:** starting at **$8/month per user** with minimum 3 members
- Enterprise Plan: Custom quote

### CloudApp Review

### 6- Loom vs. Scribe

[Loom](https://userguiding.com/blog/loom-alternatives-competitors/) is a video recording software that lets you record both yourself and your screen.

![[assets/loom-chrome-extension.jpeg]]

**Loom is a software that allows you to generate animated how-to tutorials so that your audience can easily learn all of the steps they need to get their job done.**

It offers several features, including the ability to track user activity and create an automatic transcription.

It also integrates with other programs like Visio and Powerpoint.

The disadvantage of this product is that each team member must pay a one-time fee, making it costlier for bigger organizations.

### Loom Pricing

- **Starter pack: Free of Charge**
- **Business pack: $8/month** per user if paid annually
- **Enterprise pack:** contact the sales team.

### Loom Review

### 7- Shepherd.js vs. Scribe

[Shepherd.js](https://userguiding.com/blog/shepherd-alternatives/) is an open-source website walkthrough library for developers to benefit for free.

![[assets/Shepherdjs-interface.png]]

Shepherd.js lets you create AI-powered chatbots and turn code into a wizard-style interface.

**It‚Äôs a fantastic library for creating AI-powered onboarding flows. And it comes for free.**

If you have a spare developer available, have the budget to afford one, or you yourself know how to code, Shepherd.js can lift the burden of a subscription from your shoulders.

### Shepherd.js Pricing

Shepherd.js is an open-source library and is completely free to use!

## Conclusion

So, Scribe (or Scribehow) claims to be a strong onboarding program, while user reviews don‚Äôt really agree.

Just as it is with this one, a tool might seem affordable and useful, **but there is always a better option if you do your research well.**

Take UserGuiding as an example, it is cheaper for teams larger than 4 people, and it has a wide range of useful features.

I hope I was able to help you with finding a better onboarding and customer experience tool.
